Fairy Li is washed up, Shigbeard is a literal bot medic who goes braindead about 10 minutes in to any scrim, mr.mongolia is a roster ride, and the rest are subs. Last minute change is muckmud on demo so time to enjoy main i guess?\r\n\r\nPS: Shana_Cayde is currently injured from a motorbike accident and cannot reliably play\r\n",
