This system will allow those reviewing them more time to review and accept transfers. Please refer to the [Transfer Window page here for more information](<https://ozfortress.com/forums/threads/776>).\r\n - If you are unsure on whether or not something is considered a game exploit, **contact a League Administrator for clarification.
