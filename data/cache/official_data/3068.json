            "description": "![](https://i.imgur.com/Al8DDWn.png)\r\n\r\nThe ozfortress seasonal league returns for 2021! Fresh off the exciting ozfortress Summer Cup 2021 we're ready to get back into the action!\r\n\r\nThe map pool for OZF 30 will again comprise of nine maps and certain maps will be played once during the regular season with other maps being played twice. This season we're saying goodbye to **Villa** after just one season in the active map pool. In its place we're seeing the introduction of **Clearcut**. **Clearcut** has seen recent usage in RGL and with 67% of player requesting to play it in the January 2021 poll, we've decided it's time to test it out. \r\n\r\nThere will be four or five skill divisions in OZF 30. The brackets we will feature are: Premier, High (pending signups), Intermediate, Main and Open! Both Premier and High will have a round robin group stage while the bottom divisions will consist of a Swiss group stage. All brackets will continue using the Page Playoffs format. Grand Finals for Premier shall be played as a no-advantage best of five, while all other division's Grand Finals will be a best of three. Premier and High (or Intermediate in the event of a four division season) will have eight teams while the other division's sizes are pending signups. Depending on the number of signups we receive for OZF 30, we may adjust the number of skill divisions after signups have closed.\r\n\r\nDuring OZF 30 we plan on conducting random demo checks to ensure players are recording demos. **Please ensure that you are recording match demos in order to avoid punishment.** \r\n\r\nTransfers will continue to be completed on a bi-weekly basis. The system will allow admins more time to review and accept transfers.\r\n\r\nWe will also be featuring **no new plugins** on ozfortress servers for OZF 30. All plugins used for OZF 29 will remain in place, but we will not be introducing more at this stage.\r\n\r\nThis season we will also be experimenting again with the *forfeit all matches on disband* setting. Previously, if a team disbanded during the season then all matches that they had already played would turn into forfeit wins for the other team. This season all match results from a disbanded team will stand, and no matches will be retroactively forfeited. This was also in place for OZF 29 but we were unable to thoroughly test it.\r\n\r\nAll server booking will continue to be done through ozfortress discord. Simply join the [#bookings channel](https://discord.gg/5vs4C5C) in the ozfortress Discord and type /book and details of your server booking will be PM'd to you. To view more commands, type /help in the #bookings channel.\r\n\r\nOn the ozfortress website, captains can create Teams using the \"Start Team\" button on the Teams page. Once created, captains can invite players to the team. Team invites are shown on a player's profile, which can be accessed by clicking on your name next to the bell on the top right hand corner of your screen. Teams provide a pool of players that can be signed up for a tournament. Players may be in the pool for multiple teams but only one active roster for any given tournament. Captains may sign up a roster for tournaments under the league page.\r\n\r\nIf you're new and not sure how to get started, don't fret! Check out the #recruitment section of the [ozfortress Discord](https://discord.gg/dyudcxB) where you can express your interest in joining a team, or peruse potential players to form a team of your own. Teams are *normally* comprised of one Medic, one Demoman, two Soldiers and two Scouts. If you're new to the competitive scene, [click here](https://ozfortress.com/newbie_guide) for an introduction to ozfortress! \r\n\r\n**Please ensure you have enough backups to last the season**; teams are allowed a maximum of ten players rostered on for any single tournament.  \r\n\r\nYou can sign up for ozfortress season 30 from **Sunday the 17th of January** up until **Wednesday the 27th of January**. **We aim to have seeding out by the 30th of January with the season starting on the 31st, however this is subject to change**. This gap between the closing of signups and the start of the season is to give the administration team more time to seed. **ozfortress season 30 will begin on Sunday the 31st of January**. \r\n\r\n**[[Map Pool]](https://ozfortress.com/forums/threads/609) [[Key Dates]](https://ozfortress.com/forums/threads/608) [[Unlocks]](https://ozfortress.com/forums/threads/607) [[Administrators]](https://ozfortress.com/forums/threads/606) [[Class Restrictions]](https://ozfortress.com/forums/threads/611)\r\n[[Transfers]](https://ozfortress.com/transfers) [[Transfer Windows]](https://ozfortress.com/forums/threads/610)[[Server Configuration]](https://ozfortress.com/server_configs) [[Rules]](https://ozfortress.com/rules) [[Patreon]](https://www.patreon.com/ozfortress)** \r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hlYXJWG.png)\r\n\r\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/ir8ZDml.png)](https://discord.gg/0Scfe0bjjACAuRJ0)[![](https://i.imgur.com/Q1StrNZ.png)](https://twitter.com/ozfortress) [![](https://i.imgur.com/cjzmyF9.png)](https://facebook.com/ozfortress)[![](https://i.imgur.com/ad9b3TV.png)](https://www.patreon.com/ozfortress)"
