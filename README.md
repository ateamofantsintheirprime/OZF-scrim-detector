TO DO LIST:

    1) [DONE] Hide Private Key in gitignore
        1.1) Add a template file where others can put their private keys if they want to clone the repo
    2) [DONE] Put it on github.
    3) Add error handling
        (Option 1): Shut down the app when a request fails and give an error message
        (Option 2): Continue when the error is recieved and handle the missing data (risks hammering the API when I'm getting nothing back but errors)
    4) Add individual log requesting and storing
        4.1) Decide on directory system for storing individual logs
            (Option 1): A single folder with every log named by their ID.   (nothing wrong with this)
            (Option 2): A logs folder with subfolders for each team, which then contains the logs. (neater)
        4.2) Add multithreading
        4.3) Add team alignment checking
        
    5) Add team alignment checking
    6) Add team matchup checking
    7) Add test cases (no clue)
    8) Make a config.json file that specifies all filepaths and API URL prefixes

NOTES: 

- Logs that pass the first round of trimming but not the second round will still be stored locally. It would be a not insignificant amount of work to avoid this. I wouldn't be able to use the basic make_request() function for it.

- When tackling multiple seasons, the start and end date of the season need to be considered, along side the date that the scrim was played. If a team keeps an identical roster between subsequent seasons, where do you draw the line between the scrims being allocated to the first season's roster or the second season's roster.

- Mercs? unavoidable confusion I think

===IMPORTANT IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS PROGRAM YOURSELF===

You will need your own ozfortress API key. I have no idea how to get one, I just asked core on discord and he gave it to me. 

Create a folder called ozf_api_key.json and put this in it:
```
{
    "key": <your key as a string>
}
```
